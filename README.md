# Day-Planner-Application

## Description

A Bootstrap and jQuery powered day planner for organizing tasks in a regular business day. Click the green button with the save icon to log your event. Saved tasks will persist upon reload.

As the day progresses, each time block will eventually go from blue (future) to bright blue (the current hour), to greyed out (past event).
